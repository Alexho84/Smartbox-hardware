# Overview

In order to start using the Telegea platform, a small device called **Smartbox** is needed which collects the sensor data and controls connected appliances. There are two possibilities to get into possession of such a device.

### Build your own

The Smartbox can be assembled the "do it yourself" way from commercially available components.
See [this guide](02-diy-building-instructions.md) if you want to try it.  


### Buy a complete Smartbox *(coming soon)*

We are developing a custom hardware which can be purchased as a complete turnkey solution. It includes on-board relays, sensors and all neccessary connectors for external components. It is also provided with the Telegea Smartbox software installed and ready to use.

It has the following features:  
* Based on RaspberryPi Compute Module
* On board temperature and humidity sensor
* 4 on board relays for boiler / heat pump control
* Real time clock for time keeping during reboot and power off
* 2 configurable RJ11 sensor connectors for external sensors
* XRF radio module for connectivity with wireless sensors
* 8 digital inputs for pulse counting or status signals
* RS485 interface for communication with Modbus devices
* Ethernet connector
* Wifi module *(optional)*
* 2.8" Touchscreen *(optional)*
* Wall mount or DIN rail enclosure
